# Contributing to Upjet

Welcome, and thank you for considering contributing to Upjet. We encourage
you to help out by raising issues, improving documentation, fixing bugs, or
adding new features

If you're interested in contributing please start by reading this document. If
you have any questions at all, or don't know where to start, please reach out to
us on [Slack]. Please also take a look at our [code of conduct], which details
how contributors are expected to conduct themselves.

## Contributing Code

To contribute bug fixes or features to Upjet:

1. Communicate your intent.
1. Make your changes.
1. Test your changes.
1. Update documentation and examples where appropriate.
1. Open a Pull Request (PR).

Communicating your intent lets the Upjet maintainers know that you intend
to contribute, and how. This sets you up for success - you can avoid duplicating
an effort that may already be underway, adding a feature that may be rejected,
or heading down a path that you would be steered away from at review time. The
best way to communicate your intent is via a detailed GitHub issue. Take a look
first to see if there's already an issue relating to the thing you'd like to
contribute. If there isn't, please raise a new one! Let us know what you'd like
to work on, and why. The Upjet maintainers can't always triage new issues
immediately, but we encourage you to bring them to our attention via [Slack].

Be sure to practice [good git commit hygiene] as you make your changes. All but
the smallest changes should be broken up into a few commits that tell a story.
Use your git commits to provide context for the folks who will review PR, and
the folks who will be spelunking the codebase in the months and years to come.
Ensure each of your commits is signed-off in compliance with the [Developer
Certificate of Origin] by using `git commit -s` and follow the CLA instructions.
The Upjet project highly values readable, idiomatic Go code. Familiarise
yourself with the [Coding Style] and try to preempt any comments your reviewers
would otherwise leave. Run `make reviewable` to lint your change.

All Upjet code must be covered by tests. Upjet does not use Ginkgo tests and
will request changes to any PR that uses Ginkgo or any third party testing
library, per the common Go [test review comments]. Upjet encourages the use
of table driven unit tests.

Note that when opening a PR your reviewer will expect you to detail how you've
tested your work. For all but the smallest changes some manual testing is
encouraged in addition to unit tests.

All Upjet documentation is under revision control; see the [docs] directory
of this repository. Any change that introduces new behaviour or changes existing
behaviour must include updates to any relevant documentation. Please keep
documentation changes in distinct commits.

Once your change is written, tested, and documented the final step is to have it
reviewed! You'll be presented with a template and a small checklist when you
open a PR. Please read the template and fill out the checklist. Please make all
requested changes in subsequent commits. This allows your reviewers to see what
has changed as you address their comments. Be mindful of  your commit history as
you do this - avoid commit messages like "Address review feedback" if possible.
If doing so is difficult a good alternative is to rewrite your commit history to
clean them up after your PR is approved but before it is merged.

In summary, please:

* Discuss your change in a GitHub issue before you start.
* Use your Git commit messages to communicate your intent to your reviewers.
* Sign-off on all Git commits by running `git commit -s`
* Add or update tests for all changes.
* Preempt [Coding Style] review comments.
* Update all relevant documentation.
* Don't force push to address review feedback. Your commits should tell a story.
* If necessary, tidy up your git commit history once your PR is approved.

Thank you for reading through our contributing guide! We appreciate you taking
the time to ensure your contributions are high quality and easy for our
community to review and accept. Please don't hesitate to [reach out to
us][Slack] if you have any questions about contributing!

## Establishing a Development Environment

Upjet is a set of Go packages that is imported by providers. When you make a
change in Upjet, the best way to test it is to use a `replace` statement in the
`go.mod` file of the provider to use your local version as shown below.

```
replace github.com/upbound/upjet => ../upjet
```

Once you complete your change, make sure to run `make reviewable` before opening
your PR.

In most cases, it's helpful to open the PR in your provider repositories to
show the usage and impact of your change and refer it in your Upjet PR
description. In order for this to work, you'll need to `replace` the Upjet used
in your provider to point to a certain commit in your branch of the provider that
you opened a PR for.

```
replace github.com/upbound/upjet => github.com/<your user name>/upjet <hash of the last commit from your branch>
```
