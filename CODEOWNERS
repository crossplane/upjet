# The goal of this file is for most PRs to automatically and fairly have one
# maintainer set as PR reviewers. All maintainers have permission to approve 
# and merge PRs. All PRs must be approved by at least one maintainer before being merged.
# 
# Where possible, prefer explicitly specifying a maintainer who is a subject
# matter expert for a particular part of the codebase rather than using fallback
# owners. Fallback owners are listed at the bottom of this file.
#
# See also OWNERS.md for governance details
