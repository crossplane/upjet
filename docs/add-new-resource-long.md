## Configuring a Resource

[Upjet] generates as much as it could using the available information in the
Terraform resource schema. This includes an XRM-conformant schema of the
resource, controller logic, late initialization, sensitive data handling etc.
However, there are still couple of information that requires some input
configuration which could easily be provided by checking the Terraform
documentation of the resource:

- [External name]
- [Cross Resource Referencing]
- [Additional Sensitive Fields and Custom Connection Details]
- [Late Initialization Behavior]
- [Overriding Terraform Resource Schema]
- [Initializers]

### External Name

Crossplane uses an annotation in managed resource CR to identify the external
resource which is managed by Crossplane. See [the external name documentation]
for more details. The format and source of the external name depends on the
cloud provider; sometimes it could simply be the name of resource
(e.g. S3 Bucket), and sometimes it is an auto-generated id by cloud API
(e.g. VPC id ). This is something specific to resource, and we need some input
configuration for upjet to appropriately generate a resource.

Since Terraform already needs [a similar identifier] to import a resource, most
helpful part of resource documentation is the [import section].

Upjet performs some back and forth conversions between Crossplane resource
model and Terraform configuration. We need a custom, per resource configuration
to adapt Crossplane `external name` from Terraform `id`.

Here are [the types for the External Name configuration]:

```go
// SetIdentifierArgumentsFn sets the name of the resource in Terraform attributes map,
// i.e. Main HCL file.
type SetIdentifierArgumentsFn func(base map[string]any, externalName string)
// GetExternalNameFn returns the external name extracted from the TF State.
type GetExternalNameFn func(tfstate map[string]any) (string, error)
// GetIDFn returns the ID to be used in TF State file, i.e. "id" field in
// terraform.tfstate.
type GetIDFn func(ctx context.Context, externalName string, parameters map[string]any, providerConfig map[string]any) (string, error)

// ExternalName contains all information that is necessary for naming operations,
// such as removal of those fields from spec schema and calling Configure function
// to fill attributes with information given in external name.
type ExternalName struct {
  // SetIdentifierArgumentFn sets the name of the resource in Terraform argument
  // map. In many cases, there is a field called "name" in the HCL schema, however,
  // there are cases like RDS DB Cluster where the name field in HCL is called
  // "cluster_identifier". This function is the place that you can take external
  // name and assign it to that specific key for that resource type.
  SetIdentifierArgumentFn SetIdentifierArgumentsFn

  // GetExternalNameFn returns the external name extracted from TF State. In most cases,
  // "id" field contains all the information you need. You'll need to extract
  // the format that is decided for external name annotation to use.
  // For example the following is an Azure resource ID:
  // /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1
  // The function should return "mygroup1" so that it can be used to set external
  // name if it was not set already.
  GetExternalNameFn GetExternalNameFn

  // GetIDFn returns the string that will be used as "id" key in TF state. In
  // many cases, external name format is the same as "id" but when it is not
  // we may need information from other places to construct it. For example,
  // the following is an Azure resource ID:
  // /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1
  // The function here should use information from supplied arguments to
  // construct this ID, i.e. "mygroup1" from external name, subscription ID
  // from providerConfig, and others from parameters map if needed.
  GetIDFn GetIDFn

  // OmittedFields are the ones you'd like to be removed from the schema since
  // they are specified via external name. For example, if you set
  // "cluster_identifier" in SetIdentifierArgumentFn, then you need to omit
  // that field.
  // You can omit only the top level fields.
  // No field is omitted by default.
  OmittedFields []string

  // DisableNameInitializer allows you to specify whether the name initializer
  // that sets external name to metadata.name if none specified should be disabled.
  // It needs to be disabled for resources whose external identifier is randomly
  // assigned by the provider, like AWS VPC where it gets vpc-21kn123 identifier
  // and not let you name it.
  DisableNameInitializer bool
}
```

Comments explain the purpose of each field but let's clarify further with some
example cases.

#### Case 1: Name as External Name and Terraform ID

This is the simplest and most straightforward case with the following
conditions:

- Terraform resource uses the `name` argument to identify the resources
- Terraform resource can be imported with `name`, i.e. `id`=`name`

[aws_iam_user] is a good example here. In this case, we can just use the
[NameAsIdentifier] config of Upjet as follows:

```go
import (
	"github.com/upbound/upjet/pkg/config"
	...
)

...
    p.AddResourceConfigurator("aws_iam_user", func(r *config.Resource) {
        r.ExternalName = config.NameAsIdentifier
		...
    }
```

There are some resources which fits into this case with an exception by
expecting an argument other than `name` to name/identify a resource, for
example, [bucket] for [aws_s3_bucket] and [cluster_identifier] for
[aws_rds_cluster].

Let's check [aws_s3_bucket] further. Reading the [import section of s3 bucket]
we see that bucket is imported with its **name**, however, checking _arguments_
section we see that this name is provided with the [bucket] argument. We also
notice, there is also another argument as `bucket_prefix` which conflicts with
`bucket` argument. We can just use the [NameAsIdentifier] config, however, we
also need to configure the `bucket` argument with `SetIdentifierArgumentFn` and
also omit `bucket` and `bucket_prefix` arguments from the spec with
`OmittedFields`:

```go
import (
	"github.com/upbound/upjet/pkg/config"
	...
)

...
    p.AddResourceConfigurator("aws_s3_bucket", func(r *config.Resource) {
        r.ExternalName = config.NameAsIdentifier
        r.ExternalName.SetIdentifierArgumentFn = func(base map[string]any, externalName string) {
            base["bucket"] = externalName
        }
        r.ExternalName.OmittedFields = []string{
            "bucket",
            "bucket_prefix",
        }
		...
    }
```

#### Case 2: Identifier from Provider

In this case, the (cloud) provider generates an identifier for the resource
independent of what we provided as arguments.

Checking the [import section of aws_vpc], we see that this resource is being
imported with `vpc id`. When we check the [arguments list] and provided
[example usages], it is clear that this **id** is **not** something that user
provides, rather generated by AWS API.

Here, we can just use [IdentifierFromProvider] configuration:

```go
import (
	"github.com/upbound/upjet/pkg/config"
	...
)

...
    p.AddResourceConfigurator("aws_vpc", func(r *config.Resource) {
        r.ExternalName = config.IdentifierFromProvider
		...
    }
```

#### Case 3: Terraform ID as a Formatted String

For some resources, Terraform uses a formatted string as `id` which include
resource identifier that Crossplane uses as external name but may also contain
some other parameters.

Most `azurerm` resources fall into this category. Checking the
[import section of azurerm_sql_server], we see that can be imported with an `id`
in the following format:

```
/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/myserver
```

To properly set external name for such a resource, we need to configure how to
extract external name from this string (`GetExternalNameFn`) and how to build
this id back (`GetIDFn`).

```go
import (
	"github.com/upbound/upjet/pkg/config"
	...
)

func getNameFromFullyQualifiedID(tfstate map[string]any) (string, error) {
	id, ok := tfstate["id"]
	if !ok {
		return "", errors.Errorf(ErrFmtNoAttribute, "id")
	}
	idStr, ok := id.(string)
	if !ok {
		return "", errors.Errorf(ErrFmtUnexpectedType, "id")
	}
	words := strings.Split(idStr, "/")
	return words[len(words)-1], nil
}

func getFullyQualifiedIDfunc(ctx context.Context, externalName string, parameters map[string]any, providerConfig map[string]any) (string, error) {
	subID, ok := providerConfig["subscription_id"]
    if !ok {
        return "", errors.Errorf(ErrFmtNoAttribute, "subscription_id")
    }
    subIDStr, ok := subID.(string)
    if !ok {
        return "", errors.Errorf(ErrFmtUnexpectedType, "subscription_id")
    }
    rg, ok := parameters["resource_group_name"]
    if !ok {
        return "", errors.Errorf(ErrFmtNoAttribute, "resource_group_name")
    }
    rgStr, ok := rg.(string)
    if !ok {
        return "", errors.Errorf(ErrFmtUnexpectedType, "resource_group_name")
    }

	name, ok := parameters["name"]
    if !ok {
        return "", errors.Errorf(ErrFmtNoAttribute, "name")
    }
    nameStr, ok := rg.(string)
    if !ok {
        return "", errors.Errorf(ErrFmtUnexpectedType, "name")
    }

    return fmt.Sprintf("/subscriptions/%s/resourceGroups/%s/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/%s", subIDStr, rgStr, nameStr), nil
}

...
    p.AddResourceConfigurator("azurerm_sql_server", func(r *config.Resource) {
        r.ExternalName = config.NameAsIdentifier
        r.ExternalName.GetExternalNameFn = getNameFromFullyQualifiedID
        r.ExternalName.GetIDFn = getFullyQualifiedIDfunc
		...
    }
```

With this, we have covered most common scenarios for configuring external name.
You can always check resource configurations of existing jet Providers as
further examples under `config/<group>/config.go` in their repositories.

_Please see [this figure] to understand why we really need 3 different
functions to configure external names and, it visualizes which is used how._

### Cross Resource Referencing

Crossplane uses cross resource referencing to [handle dependencies] between
managed resources. For example, if you have an IAM User defined as a Crossplane
managed resource, and you want to create an Access Key for that user, you would
need to refer to the User CR from the Access Key resource. This is handled by
cross resource referencing.

See how the [user] referenced at `forProvider.userRef.name` field of the
Access Key in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: iam.aws.tf.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: User
metadata:
  name: sample-user
spec:
  forProvider: {}
---
apiVersion: iam.aws.tf.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: AccessKey
metadata:
  name: sample-access-key
spec:
  forProvider:
    userRef:
      name: sample-user
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: sample-access-key-secret
    namespace: crossplane-system
```

Historically, reference resolution method were written by hand which requires
some effort, however, with the latest Crossplane code generation tooling, it is
now possible to [generate reference resolution methods] by just adding some
marker on the fields. Now, the only manual step for generating cross resource
references is to provide which field of a resource depends on which information
(e.g. `id`, `name`, `arn` etc.) from the other.

In Upjet, we have a [configuration] to provide this information for a field:

```go
// Reference represents the Crossplane options used to generate
// reference resolvers for fields
type Reference struct {
    // Type is the type name of the CRD if it is in the same package or
    // <package-path>.<type-name> if it is in a different package.
    Type string
    // Extractor is the function to be used to extract value from the
    // referenced type. Defaults to getting external name.
    // Optional
    Extractor string
    // RefFieldName is the field name for the Reference field. Defaults to
    // <field-name>Ref or <field-name>Refs.
    // Optional
    RefFieldName string
    // SelectorFieldName is the field name for the Selector field. Defaults to
    // <field-name>Selector.
    // Optional
    SelectorFieldName string
}
```

For a resource that we want to generate, we need to check its argument list in
Terraform documentation and figure out which field needs reference to which
resource.

Let's check [iam_access_key] as an example. In the argument list, we see the
[user] field which requires a reference to a IAM user. So, we need to the
following referencing configuration:

```go
func Configure(p *config.Provider) {
    p.AddResourceConfigurator("aws_iam_access_key", func (r *config.Resource) {
        r.References["user"] = config.Reference{
            Type: "User",
        }
    })
}
```

Please note the value of `Type` field needs to be a string representing the Go
type of the resource. Since, `AccessKey` and `User` resources are under the same
go package, we don't need to provide the package path. However, this is not
always the case and referenced resources might be in different package. In that
case, we would need to provide the full path. Referencing to a [kms key] from
`aws_ebs_volume` resource is a good example here:

```go
func Configure(p *config.Provider) {
	p.AddResourceConfigurator("aws_ebs_volume", func(r *config.Resource) {
		r.References["kms_key_id"] = config.Reference{
			Type: "github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-tf-aws/apis/kms/v1alpha1.Key",
		}
	})
}
```

### Additional Sensitive Fields and Custom Connection Details

Crossplane stores sensitive information of a managed resource in a Kubernetes
secret, together with some additional fields that would help consumption of the
resource, a.k.a. [connection details].

In Upjet, we already handle sensitive fields that are marked as sensitive
in Terraform schema and no further action required for them. Upjet will
properly hide these fields from CRD spec and status by converting to a secret
reference or storing in connection details secret respectively. However, we
still have some custom configuration API that would allow including additional
fields into connection details secret no matter they are sensitive or not.

As an example, let's use `aws_iam_access_key`. Currently, Upjet stores all
sensitive fields in Terraform schema as prefixed with `attribute.`, so without
any `AdditionalConnectionDetailsFn`, connection resource will have
`attribute.id` and `attribute.secret` corresponding to [id] and [secret] fields
respectively. To see them with more common keys, i.e. `aws_access_key_id` and
`aws_secret_access_key`, we would need to make the following configuration:

```go
func Configure(p *config.Provider) {
	p.AddResourceConfigurator("aws_iam_access_key", func(r *config.Resource) {
		r.Sensitive.AdditionalConnectionDetailsFn = func(attr map[string]any) (map[string][]byte, error) {
			conn := map[string][]byte{}
			if a, ok := attr["id"].(string); ok {
				conn["aws_access_key_id"] = []byte(a)
			}
			if a, ok := attr["secret"].(string); ok {
				conn["aws_secret_access_key"] = []byte(a)
			}
			return conn, nil
		}
	})
}
```

This will produce a connection details secret as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  attribute.id: QUtJQVk0QUZUVFNFNDI2TlhKS0I=
  attribute.secret: ABCxyzRedacted==
  attribute.ses_smtp_password_v4: QQ00REDACTED==
  aws_access_key_id: QUtJQVk0QUZUVFNFNDI2TlhKS0I=
  aws_secret_access_key: ABCxyzRedacted==
kind: Secret
```

### Late Initialization Configuration

Late initialization configuration is only required if there are conflicting
arguments in terraform resource configuration.
Unfortunately, there is _no easy way_ to figure that out without testing the
resource, _so feel free to skip this configuration_ at the first place and
revisit _only if_ you have errors like below while testing the resource.

```
observe failed: cannot run refresh: refresh failed: Invalid combination of arguments:
  "address_prefix": only one of `address_prefix,address_prefixes` can be specified, but `address_prefix,address_prefixes` were specified.: File name: main.tf.json
```

If you would like to have the late-initialization library *not* to process the
[`address_prefix`] parameter field, then the following configuration where we
specify the parameter field path is sufficient:

```go
func Configure(p *config.Provider) {
	p.AddResourceConfigurator("azurerm_subnet", func(r *config.Resource) {
		r.LateInitializer = config.LateInitializer{
			IgnoredFields: []string{"address_prefix"},
		}
	})
}
```

_Please note that, there could be errors looking slightly different from above,
so please consider configuring late initialization behaviour whenever you got
some unexpected error starting with `observe failed:`, once you are sure that
you provided all necessary parameters to your resource._

#### Further details on Late Initialization

Upjet runtime automatically performs late-initialization during
an [`external.Observe`] call with means of runtime reflection.
State of the world observed by Terraform CLI is used to initialize
any `nil`-valued pointer parameters in the managed resource's `spec`.
In most of the cases no custom configuration should be necessary for
late-initialization to work. However, there are certain cases where
you will want/need to customize late-initialization behaviour. Thus,
Upjet provides an extensible [late-initialization customization API]
that controls late-initialization behaviour.

The associated resource struct is defined [here](https://github.com/upbound/upjet/blob/c9e21387298d8ed59fcd71c7f753ec401a3383a5/pkg/config/resource.go#L91) as follows:

```go
// LateInitializer represents configurations that control
// late-initialization behaviour
type LateInitializer struct {
    // IgnoredFields are the canonical field names to be skipped during
    // late-initialization
    IgnoredFields []string
}
```

Currently, it only involves a configuration option to specify
certain `spec` parameters to be ignored during late-initialization.
Each element of the `LateInitializer.IgnoredFields` slice represents
the canonical path relative to the parameters struct for the managed resource's `Spec`
using `Go` type names as path elements. As an example, with the following type definitions:

```go
type Subnet struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
    metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
    Spec              SubnetSpec   `json:"spec"`
    Status            SubnetStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`
}

type SubnetSpec struct {
    ForProvider     SubnetParameters `json:"forProvider"`
    ...
}

type DelegationParameters struct {
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Required
    Name *string `json:"name" tf:"name,omitempty"`
    ...
}

type SubnetParameters struct {
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Optional
    AddressPrefix *string `json:"addressPrefix,omitempty" tf:"address_prefix,omitempty"`
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Optional
    Delegation []DelegationParameters `json:"delegation,omitempty" tf:"delegation,omitempty"`
    ...
}
```

In most cases, custom late-initialization configuration will not be necessary.
However, after generating a new managed resource and observing its behaviour
(at runtime), it may turn out that late-initialization behaviour needs
customization. For certain resources like the `provider-tf-azure`'s
`PostgresqlServer` resource, we have observed that Terraform state contains
values for mutually exclusive parameters, e.g., for `PostgresqlServer`, both
`StorageMb` and `StorageProfile[].StorageMb` get late-initialized. Upon next
reconciliation, we generate values for both parameters in the Terraform
configuration, and although they happen to have the same value, Terraform
configuration validation requires them to be mutually exclusive. Currently, we
observe this behaviour at runtime, and upon observing that the resource cannot
transition to the `Ready` state and acquires the Terraform validation error
message in its `status.conditions`, we do the `LateInitializer.IgnoreFields`
custom configuration detailed above to skip one of the mutually exclusive fields
during late-initialization.

### Overriding Terraform Resource Schema

Upjet generates Crossplane resource schemas (CR spec/status) using the
[Terraform schema of the resource]. As of today, Upjet leverages the
following attributes in the schema:

- [Type] and [Elem] to identify the type of the field.
- [Sensitive] to see if we need to keep it in a Secret instead of CR.
- [Description] to add as a description to the field in CRD.
- [Optional] and [Computed] to identify whether the fields go under spec or
status:
  - Not Optional & Not Computed => Spec (required)
  - Optional & Not Computed => Spec (optional)
  - Optional & Computed => Spec (optional, to be late-initialized)
  - Not Optional & Computed => Status

Usually, we don't need to make any modifications in the resource schema and
resource schema just works as is. However, there could be some rare edge cases
like:

- Field contains sensitive information but not marked as `Sensitive` or vice
versa.
- An attribute does not make sense to have in CRD schema, like
[tags_all for jet AWS resources].
- Moving parameters from Terraform provider config to resources schema to
fit Crossplane model, e.g. [AWS region] parameter is part of provider config
in Terraform but Crossplane expects it in CR spec.

Schema of a resource could be overridden as follows:

```go
p.AddResourceConfigurator("aws_autoscaling_group", func(r *config.Resource) {
    // Managed by Attachment resource.
    if s, ok := r.TerraformResource.Schema["load_balancers"]; ok {
        s.Optional = false
        s.Computed = true
    }
    if s, ok := r.TerraformResource.Schema["target_group_arns"]; ok {
        s.Optional = false
        s.Computed = true
    }
})
```

### Initializers

Initializers involve the operations that run before beginning of reconciliation. This configuration option will
provide that setting initializers for per resource.

Many resources in aws have `tags` field in their schema. Also, in Crossplane there is a [tagging convention].
To implement the tagging convention for jet-aws provider, this initializer configuration support was provided.

There is a common struct (`Tagger`) in upjet to use the tagging convention:

```go
// Tagger implements the Initialize function to set external tags
type Tagger struct {
	kube      client.Client
	fieldName string
}

// NewTagger returns a Tagger object.
func NewTagger(kube client.Client, fieldName string) *Tagger {
	return &Tagger{kube: kube, fieldName: fieldName}
}

// Initialize is a custom initializer for setting external tags
func (t *Tagger) Initialize(ctx context.Context, mg xpresource.Managed) error {
	paved, err := fieldpath.PaveObject(mg)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	pavedByte, err := setExternalTagsWithPaved(xpresource.GetExternalTags(mg), paved, t.fieldName)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if err := json.Unmarshal(pavedByte, mg); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if err := t.kube.Update(ctx, mg); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}
```

As seen above, the `Tagger` struct accepts a `fieldName`. This `fieldName` specifies which value of field to set in the
resource's spec. You can use the common `Initializer` by specifying the field name that points to the external tags
in the configured resource.

There is also a default initializer for tagging convention, `TagInitializer`. It sets the value of `fieldName` to `tags`
as default:

```go
// TagInitializer returns a tagger to use default tag initializer.
var TagInitializer NewInitializerFn = func(client client.Client) managed.Initializer {
	return NewTagger(client, "tags")
}
```

In jet-aws provider, as a default process, if a resource has `tags` field in its schema, then the default initializer
(`TagInitializer`) is added to Initializer list of resource:

```go
// AddExternalTagsField adds ExternalTagsFieldName configuration for resources that have tags field.
func AddExternalTagsField() tjconfig.ResourceOption {
	return func(r *tjconfig.Resource) {
		if s, ok := r.TerraformResource.Schema["tags"]; ok && s.Type == schema.TypeMap {
			r.InitializerFns = append(r.InitializerFns, tjconfig.TagInitializer)
		}
	}
}
```

However, if the field name that used for the external label is different from the `tags`, the `NewTagger` function can be
called and the specific `fieldName` can be passed to this:

```go
r.InitializerFns = append(r.InitializerFns, func(client client.Client) managed.Initializer {
	return tjconfig.NewTagger(client, "example_tags_name")
})
```

If the above tagging convention logic does not work for you, and you want to use this configuration option for a reason
other than tagging convention (for another custom initializer operation), you need to write your own struct in provider
and have this struct implement the `Initializer` function with a custom logic.

This configuration option is set by using the [InitializerFns] field that is a list of [NewInitializerFn]:

```go
// NewInitializerFn returns the Initializer with a client.
type NewInitializerFn func(client client.Client) managed.Initializer
```

Initializer is an interface in [crossplane-runtime]:

```go
type Initializer interface {
	Initialize(ctx context.Context, mg resource.Managed) error
}
```

So, an interface must be passed to the related configuration field for adding initializers for a resource.
