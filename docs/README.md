# What is Upjet?

Upjet consists of four main components:

![Upjet components](images/upjet-components.png)

1. Framework to build a code generator pipeline for Crossplane providers.
1. Generic reconciler implementation (also known as the Upjet runtime) used by
   all generated `CustomResourceDefinitions`.
1. A scraper to extract documentation for all generated
   `CustomResourceDefinitions`.
1. Migration framework to support migrating from community providers to Official
   Providers.

## Generating a Crossplane provider using Upjet

Follow the guide to start [generating a Crossplane
provider](generating-a-provider.md).

Further information on developing a provider:

- Guide for how to [configure a resource](configuring-a-resource.md) in your
provider.
- Guide on how to use Uptest to [test your resources](testing-with-uptest.md)
end to end.
- Guide on how to add support for
[management policies](adding-support-for-management-policies.md) to an existing
provider.
- Guide on how to [add a new resource](adding-new-resource.md) to an existing provider.

## Additional documentation
